# Semanticizer

The Semanticizer is a web service application for semantic linking
created in 2012 by [Daan Odijk](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dodijk/)
at [ILPS](http://ilps.science.uva.nl/) (University of Amsterdam).

This project since received contributions from (in alphabetical order):

The algorithms for this webservice are developed for and described in
a OAIR2013 publication on
[Feeding the Second Screen](http://ilps.science.uva.nl/biblio/feeding-second-screen-semantic-linking-based-subtitles)
by [Daan Odijk](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dodijk/),
[Edgar Meij](http://edgar.meij.pro/) and
[Maarten de Rijke](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~mdr/).  Part of this
research was inspired by earlier ILPS publications:
[Adding Semantics to Microblog Posts](http://ilps.science.uva.nl/biblio/adding-semantics-microblog-posts)
and
[Mapping Queries To The Linking Open Data Cloud](http://ilps.science.uva.nl/node/889).
If you use this webservice for your own research, please include a
reference to the OAIR2013 article or alternatively any of these
articles.

The [online documentation](http://semanticize.uva.nl/doc/) describes
how to use the Semanticizer Web API. This
[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)-like
web service returns [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and is exposed to
public at: http://semanticize.uva.nl/api/. Currently an access key for
the webservice is not needed.

The [code](https://github.com/semanticize/semanticizer/) is released
under LGPL license (see below). If you have any questions, contact
[Daan](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dodijk/).

If you want to dive into the code, start at `semanticizer/server/__main__.py`.


## Requirements

1. The software has been tested with Python 2.7.3 on Mac OS X 2.8 and
   Linux (RedHat EL5, Debian jessie/sid and Ubuntu 12.04.)

2. The following Python modules need to be installed (using
   easy_install or pip):

   * nltk
   * leven
   * networkx
   * lxml
   * flask
   * redis (optional, see point 4)
   * scikit-learn (optional, see point 6)
   * scipy (optional, see point 6)
   * mock (optional, used by the tests)

3. A summary of a Wikipedia dump is needed. For this, download the
   [Wikipedia Miner CSV files](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikipedia-miner/files/data/).

4. Copy one of the two config files in the `conf` folder to
   `semanticizer.yml` in that folder and adapt to your situation. You
   have the choice of loading all data into memory (use
   `semanticizer.memory.yml`) or into [Redis](http://redis.io/) using
   the following steps:

	1. Copy `semanticizer.redis.yml` into `semanticizer.yml`.

	2. Redis server needs to be set up and running.

	3. Load data into redis: `python -m semanticizer.dbinsert [--language=<languagecode>] [--output=/tmp/redisinsert.log]`.

4. Run the server using `python -m semanticizer.server`.

5. In order to work with the features you need to install the
   scikit-learn and scipy packages. Before installing scipy you need
   to have [swig](http://www.swig.org/download.html) installed. See
   its INSTALL for instructions. (configure, make, make
   install). Note that working with features is still under active
   development and therefore not fully documented and tested.
